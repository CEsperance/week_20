# Week_20
## To run the program:
In the mapper code is in the mapper.py file. The code is used to find the only word and punctuations, not numbers and to assign the value of of. All of the words have been lower cased to handle words that are the same even if they are capitalized or lower cased. 
A reducer.py file was created to take all the words from the mapper and count them. Below is a screenshot of the line used to count the words and punctuations in the cats_txt.txt
